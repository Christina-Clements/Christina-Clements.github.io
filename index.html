  After receiving my B.A. at KU, I took accounting positions, and focused on precision to detail. I next chose a non-traditional role as a stay at home mom and virtual teacher. I forged another path upon diagnosis of Adult Onset Type 1 Diabetes. While teaching my children by day, I took a physically active evening part-time job. My health improved, and I thrived in the cultural diversity of Amazon. Within the year, I promoted to a full- time position. I’ve proven flexible in many paths, but have been honest when something was not optimal. I have an empathetic communication style, but will not ignore issues detrimental to the customer, employee safety, or to business. Rather, I stand firm and take initiative to improve such situations. My performance continually shows low error and high improvement. I am now in KU’s Data Analytics Bootcamp, and will bring full passion to my career.
